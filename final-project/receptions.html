                    <h2>Accomodations</h2>
                    <p>Reserve a block of rooms for your guests at special rates at our hotel with plenty of time before the big event. At most hotels, and as a general rule, the minimum number of guests rooms required to make a block is 10 rooms per night. If, however, you are holding the reception at our hotel or using any banquet space, that number can be flexed. This way your guests can have a choice between different locations and prices.
